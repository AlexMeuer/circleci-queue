version: 2.1
description: |
  Allows jobs or entire workflows to be queued to ensure they run in serial.  
  This is ideal for deployments or other activities that must not run concurrently.
  May optionaly consider branch-level isolation if unique branches should run concurrently. 
  This orb requires the project to have an API key in order to query build states.
  It requires a single environment variable CIRCLECI_API_KEY which can be created in account settings - https://circleci.com/account/api.

  single_concurrency_job:
    description: |
      Used to ensure that a only single job (deploy) is not run concurrently. 
      By default will only queue if the same job from previous worfklows is running on the same branch. 
      This allows safe jobs like build/test to overlap, minimizing overall queue times.
    usage:
      version: 2.1
      orbs:
        queue: eddiewebb/queue@volatile

      workflows:
        build_deploy:

        build:

            - image: circleci/node:10
          steps:
            - run: echo "This job can overlap"

        deploy:
          docker:
            - image: circleci/node:10
          steps:
            - queue/until_front_of_line:

            - run: echo "This job will not overlap"
